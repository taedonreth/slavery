"""
An IP address is a formatted 32-bit unsigned integer where each group of 8 bits is printed as a decimal number and the dot character '.' splits the groups.

For example, the binary number 00001111 10001000 11111111 01101011 (spaces added for clarity) formatted as an IP address would be "15.136.255.107".
A CIDR block is a format used to denote a specific set of IP addresses. It is a string consisting of a base IP address, followed by a slash, followed by a prefix length k. The addresses it covers are all the IPs whose first k bits are the same as the base IP address.

For example, "123.45.67.89/20" is a CIDR block with a prefix length of 20. Any IP address whose binary representation matches 01111011 00101101 0100xxxx xxxxxxxx, where x can be either 0 or 1, is in the set covered by the CIDR block.
You are given a start IP address ip and the number of IP addresses we need to cover n. Your goal is to use as few CIDR blocks as possible to cover all the IP addresses in the inclusive range [ip, ip + n - 1] exactly. No other IP addresses outside of the range should be covered.

Return the shortest list of CIDR blocks that covers the range of IP addresses. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

        You'll need a loop that continues as long as n (the number of IPs to cover) is greater than zero. Inside the loop, you'll perform these steps:
        Calculate the Block Size: This is the most important step. You need to find the size of the block you're going to create. As we discussed, this size is the minimum of two values:
        The largest block the starting IP allows. A great trick for this is the bitwise operation start_ip & -start_ip. This isolates the lowest set bit, which is exactly the largest power of 2 that divides start_ip.
        The largest block the remaining n allows. This is the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n.
        Calculate the Prefix Length: Once you have the block size (which will be a power of 2, like 8), you need to convert it to a prefix length. You can do this by finding the exponent. For example, since 8=2
        3
         , the number of bits for the host is 3. The prefix length is then 32âˆ’3=29. The result is a /29.
        Construct and Store the CIDR String: Use your IntToIp helper to convert the current start_ip back to a string, then append the slash and the prefix length you just calculated. Add this string to your results list.
        Update for the Next Iteration:
        Add the block size to start_ip.
        Subtract the block size from n.
        Repeat this process until n is zero, and you will have your complete list of CIDR blocks.
